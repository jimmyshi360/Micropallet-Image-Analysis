# Micropallet Array Image Processing Software
Created in association with University of California Irvine researchers (Jo and Guilia).

This repository contains the Java source code for a user interface and backend algorithms for tallying radioactive markers across multiple high and low contrast imaging channels produced after a micropallet experiment.

The end goal is to provide researchers with a smooth and rapid way to analyze Micropallet experiments. A fully functional prototype version of the software was already delivered and under experimental use.
