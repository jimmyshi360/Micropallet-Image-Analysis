# Micropallet Array Image Processing Software
Created in association with University of California Irvine Cancer Research Institute - Nelson Lab

This repository contains the Java source code for a user interface and backend algorithms for tallying radioactive markers across multiple high and low contrast imaging channels produced after a micropallet experiment.

The end goal is to provide researchers with a smooth and rapid way to analyze Micropallet experiments.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
All included.

## Running the tests
Open in any IDE and run "ImageInterface.java". Alternatively, manually build a compact JAR file and run that instead.
Experimental JAR file is included. To run it, move it outside of this directory to any other directory and double click and run.

## Built With

* Java (Swing for the frontend)

## Versioning

```
Java SE8
Project version 2.0
```
