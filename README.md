# Micropallet Array Image Processing Software
Created in association with University of California Irvine Cancer Research Institute - Nelson Lab

This repository contains the Java source code for a user interface and backend algorithms for tallying radioactive markers across multiple high and low contrast imaging channels produced after a micropallet experiment.
